run_analysis.R will take the data located in the uci folder, clean it up, and output a cleaned up dataset called tidydataset.txt.

run_analysis loads the data, merges the test and training data, adds labels and isolates just the mean and standard deviation of the variables. This is data is then averaged and outputted.
